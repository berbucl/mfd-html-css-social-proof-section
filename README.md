# MFD - Challenge: Social proof section (HTML, SCSS)

![Design preview for the Social proof section coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this social proof section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. 

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

1. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes that you could create to make reusable styles.
2. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
3. Use semantic HTML tags and SCSS
4. Commit your work (continously)

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
